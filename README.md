# Cyclistic Bike Share: Analyzing Rider Behavior - Capstone Project

## Overview
Welcome to my capstone project repository for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate! This project showcases my ability to apply data analytics techniques, using a combination of SQL, spreadsheets, and R programming, to derive insights from real-world data. The project was originally created as a notebook on Kaggle and then adapted to GitHub, where I present the analysis, visualizations, and actionable insights.

## Project Description
This project analyzes bike-sharing data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company, to understand rider behavior and identify trends. The key focus is on the use of SQL for data analysis, spreadsheets for data cleaning and transformation, and R for visualizing the results.

The analysis involves:

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Using SQL and spreadsheets for data cleaning and preparation.
- **Analysis**: SQL queries for exploring trends, patterns, and insights within the data.
- **Visualizations**: Using R to generate meaningful visualizations to communicate the analysis results effectively.

## Whatâ€™s Included:
- **R Markdown File**: This file outlines my analytical approach, integrating SQL query results and processed spreadsheet data, and includes R-coded visualizations.
- **Data Files**: SQL query results and processed data from spreadsheets used for visualizations.
- **Knitted HTML & PDF**: Two formats of the full final report, as originally formatted on Kaggle, with code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Project Deliverables
- **R Markdown File**: Provides a detailed walkthrough of my analysis, integrating SQL results and spreadsheet data with R-coded visualizations.
- **Data Files**: Contains the raw SQL query results and processed data files from spreadsheets.
- **Final Reports (HTML & PDF)**: Reflects the full final analysis, as it was originally presented on Kaggle, with all code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Key Findings & Recommendations
At the end of the project, I provided actionable insights for stakeholders:

- **Targeted Recommendations**: Based on stakeholder questions, I provided recommendations to help the company improve its operations.
- **Next Steps**: I outlined actionable steps to implement the recommendations and maximize insights for business growth.
