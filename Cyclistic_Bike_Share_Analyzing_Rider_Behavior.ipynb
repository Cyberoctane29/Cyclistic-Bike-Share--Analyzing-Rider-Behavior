    "\n",
    "As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, I am tasked with analyzing the company's historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. This analysis aims to identify trends and insights that will help design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The project will follow the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, with the ultimate goal of presenting data-driven recommendations to the Cyclistic executive team."

    "**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Task\n",
    "The primary objective is to analyze the historical bike trip data to uncover how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. The insights gained from this analysis will be used to inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thereby increasing the company's profitability and customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "The key stakeholders for this analysis include:\n",
    "- **Lily Moreno:** Director of Marketing, responsible for developing campaigns and initiatives to promote Cyclistic.\n",
    "- **Cyclistic Marketing Team:** A group of data analysts and marketers who will use the insights to craft marketing strategies.\n",
    "- **Cyclistic Executive Team:** The decision-makers who will approve the recommended marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Deliverables\n",
    "The final deliverables will include a comprehensive analysis of the data, visualizations to support key findings, and three data-driven recommendations to help Cyclistic convert casual riders into annual members.\n"

    "To analyze and identify trends, I used Cyclistic's historical trip data from recent months. This public data, provided by `Motivate International Inc.` under the appropriate license, allows me to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. However, it is important to note that data-privacy issues prevent the use of personally identifiable information, meaning I cannot link purchases to specific customers or identify if casual riders live in the service area or have made multiple single-pass purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is well-organized into Monthly Trip Data files. Each zip file (e.g., `202004-divvy-tripdata.zip`) contains a CSV file (e.g., `202004-divvy-tripdata.csv`) with essential attributes such as `ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, and member_casual`. These columns provide all the necessary information for analyzing ride patterns and behaviors, focusing on annual members and casual riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the dataset is generally reliable, it does have some potential biases. As publicly available data, it may not perfectly reflect all geographic or demographic variations, and since personal identifiers have been removed, certain detailed analyses—such as demographics—cannot be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ROCCC Criteria**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reliable**: Sourced from Motivate International Inc.\n",
    "* **Original**: Directly collected from Cyclistic’s bike-share system.\n",
    "* **Comprehensive**: Includes a year's worth of data.\n",
    "* **Current**: Data from the latest 12 months.\n",
    "* **Cited**: Clearly cited licensing information and source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of licensing, the dataset is publicly available under the appropriate license from Motivate International Inc., with privacy safeguards ensuring personal data is excluded. The data is stored securely in accessible formats like CSV and ZIP files, making it easy to download and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the integrity of the data, I conducted several checks. Missing values were identified, particularly in the station-related fields (start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id), and consistency checks were carried out to ensure the formatting was correct. I also validated file completeness by confirming that no files were truncated or corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is comprehensive enough to answer key questions about usage patterns, ride behaviors, and membership types, allowing me to draw meaningful insights for Cyclistic. However, some issues, such as incomplete records and anonymized data, limit the analysis to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, I also used tools like Google Sheets to explore and organize the data, sorting and filtering key fields to ensure the dataset was ready for deeper analysis.\n",

    "### **Final Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis of Cyclistic’s bike usage data, we observed distinct differences between **casual riders** and **annual members** in terms of **ride length, peak usage hours, and ride purpose**. **Members** tend to take **shorter rides**, especially during **peak commuting hours**, while **casual riders** engage in **longer, more leisurely rides, particularly during mid-day and weekends**. These insights provide clear opportunities to tailor marketing strategies to convert **casual riders into annual members** by addressing their **specific needs and usage patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Top Three Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promote Leisure Riding Benefits**: **Casual riders** are more likely to engage in **extended, recreational rides, particularly on weekends** and during **off-peak hours**. Cyclistic can develop marketing campaigns that emphasize the benefits of **membership for longer rides**, such as **discounted extended ride options** or **scenic route suggestions**. By positioning **membership** as a **value-add for leisure riders**, Cyclistic can attract **casual riders** who regularly engage in **longer trips**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Offer Off-Peak Discounts**: Since **casual riders** dominate **off-peak hours**, Cyclistic could introduce **promotions or discounted rates** for rides during these times. This strategy can incentivize **casual riders** to use the service more frequently and potentially consider a **membership for long-term savings**. **Targeted offers**, such as **reduced fees for rides between 10 AM and 3 PM**, can convert casual riders who prefer riding during **non-commuting hours**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-Based Membership Features**: Many **casual riders** prefer **mid-day and weekend rides**, while members tend to use bikes for **commuting during peak hours**. Cyclistic could introduce **flexible, time-based membership options** that cater to this behavior, such as **weekend-only memberships or pay-per-hour passes** that offer a **middle ground between casual riding and full membership**. Highlighting the **convenience and cost-effectiveness** of such options could appeal to **casual riders hesitant to commit to an annual plan**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Application of Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings can be applied to develop targeted **marketing campaigns, refine pricing strategies, and optimize customer engagement**. Tailoring **membership features and promotions** to the distinct patterns of **casual riders** will increase the **likelihood of converting them to members**. The Cyclistic marketing team could leverage these insights in **personalized emails, app notifications, and social media campaigns** aimed at **casual riders who frequently take long rides or ride during off-peak hours**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pilot New Membership Options**: Test new time-based or weekend membership packages with a selected group of casual riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expand Data Analysis**: Further analyze rider demographics and preferences to refine marketing efforts and ensure targeted messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Optimization**: Monitor the success of promotional offers and membership options through A/B testing and customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "To deepen this analysis, more granular data on demographics, rider motivations, and geographical locations would help further tailor marketing strategies and understand the key factors influencing casual rider behavior."
